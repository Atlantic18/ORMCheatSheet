      <h3>About ORM Cheatsheet</h3>
      <p>This cheatsheet is intended as a quick reference guide for everyone working with PHP ORM frameworks and with ORM frameworks in general. We made a core of the for the ORMs we are dealing with in our daily work. This site is now open for ORM developers community to use and extend. If you feel anything is missing, feel free to contribute or let us know.</p>
      <p>Any framework is welcomed, but we can make sure only the Doctrine, Propel and CakePHP definitions are correct, so if you want to add your favourite framework section, you'll have to work on the code yourself.</p>
      <p>If you want to leave any feedback contact us on email: <a href="mailto:developers@ormcheatsheet.com">developers@ormcheatsheet.com</a></p>
