Define the following requirement in your `composer.json` file:

~~~php
{
    "require": {
        "doctrine/orm": "*"
    }
}
~~~

Then call `composer install` from your command line. For more details consult [Doctrine2 documentation](http://doctrine-orm.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/configuration.html#installation-and-configuration) or [Composer documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).
